    <p>Bharatanatyam is a major Hindu form of Indian classical</br> dance that originated in the modern-day region of Tamil Nadu.</br> The Natya Shastra by Bharata Muni and Abhinaya </br>Darpana (Mirror of Gesture)</br> by Nandikeshvara are considered to be the original sources</br> one of Bharatanatyam (an Indian classical dance form). </br>The dance form is also briefly mentioned in Kannada text</br> Manasolalla written by Someshwara III. It has flourished in the temples and courts</br> of southern India since ancient times.[1][2][3] It is one of eight widely</br> recognized Indian classical dance forms and it expresses South Indian</br> religious themes and spiritual ideas, particularly of Shaivis</p>

        <p>Kuchipudi is a dance-drama performance, with </br>its roots in the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text of Natya Shastra.</br>[4][5][6] It developed as a religious art linked to traveling bards,</br> temples and spiritual beliefs, like all</br> major classical dances of India.[7] </br>Evidence of Kuchipudi's existence in an older version are </br>found in copper inscriptions of the 10th century, and </br>by the 15th century in texts such as</br> the Machupalli Kaifat.[8][9].</br> Kuchipudi tradition holds that Tirtha Narayana Yati – </br>a sanyassin of Advaita Vedanta persuasion,[10]</br> and his disciple,</br> an orphan named Siddhendra Yogi, founded and systematized</br> the modern version of Kuchipudi in the 17th century.[11][12][13] </br>Kuchipudi largely developed as a Krishna-oriented Vaishnavism tradition,[14] and</br>it is known by the name of Bhagavata Mela in Thanjavur.[8]</p>

        <p>Odissi (Odia: ଓଡ଼ିଶୀ), also referred to as Orissi in older literature,</br> is a major ancient Indian classical dance that </br>originated in the Hindu temples of Odisha</br> – an eastern coastal state of India.[1][2][3]</br> Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women,</br>[1][4]and expressed religious stories and spiritual ideas,</br> particularly of Vaishnavism. Odissi performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions</br> such as those related to Hindu Gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu Goddesses (Shaktism).[5]</br> The theoretical foundations of Odissi trace to the ancient Sanskrit text Natya Shastra,</br> its existence in antiquity evidenced by the dance poses in the sculptures </br>of Odissi Hindu temples,[1][6] and archeological sites related to Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma),</br> Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
